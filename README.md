# Gomycode_ydata_profiling_checkpoint

This repository highlights the checkpoint for the ydata_profiling in the Gomycode Learn Platform. The dataset is for practicing purposes only and the repository is for anyone interested in knowing how the ydata_profiling library works to generate reports of your dataset and the instructors of the bootcamp for grading purposes.

The objectives for the checkpoint are highlighted below:

## Step 1: Data exploration with Pandas
  Download the provided dataset
  Use pandas to read the file into a pandas Dataframe.
  Display general information about the dataset.
  Run descriptive analysis on the dataset using the 'describe' function.
## Step 2: Data exploration with ydata-profiling
  Use ydata-profiling to generate a report of the provided dataset.
  Look for missing values in the dataset. You can use the report generated by ydata to identify missing values.
  Examine the correlations between different columns in the dataset. You can use the report generated by ydata to identify correlations.
  Identify any other interesting patterns or insights in the dataset that you can discover through the ydata-profiling report.
## Step 3: Summary
  Write a summary of your findings based on the ydata-profiling report. Be sure to include any interesting patterns or insights you discovered in the dataset.
